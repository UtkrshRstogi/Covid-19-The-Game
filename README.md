# Covid 19 The game
The basic idea behind this game is to spread awareness and let people know why staying at home is important. With each and every passing day this pandemic is taking a more aggressive form and the fun fact being that people are not taking it for seriously and this ideology of people has destroyed countries like USA, Italy, Spain etc.
Working on a solution to solve is important but spreading awareness is also important and thus in this digital world the best way to reach people is using games and social media etc. 
Kindly please help us in this time of hardship and let us unite to beat the COVID-19 together.
